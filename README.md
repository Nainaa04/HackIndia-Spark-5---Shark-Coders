# Deepfake Detection Web Application

## Overview
This project is a web application designed to detect deepfake content using a combination of front-end technologies and Web3 for blockchain interactions. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload media files to check for deepfakes and interact with a smart contract to record verification results on the blockchain.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Web3.js
- **Deepfake Detection**: Integration with an external API (placeholder used for demo)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity

## Features
- **Upload Media**: Users can upload images or videos.
- **Deepfake Detection**: The application uses a placeholder for deepfake detection. Replace it with a real API for actual use.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Records the result of the deepfake detection to the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

## Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
    cd deepfake-detection
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    - Install any required dependencies using npm (if applicable).

3. **Start the Local Server**
    - Open the `index.html` file directly or use a local server like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.liveServer) for Visual Studio Code.

4. **Access the Application**
    - Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/DEEPFAKE/FRONTEND/index.html` to view and interact with the application.

## Usage

1. **Upload a File**: Click the "Choose File" button to select an image or video file from your computer.
2. **Check for Deepfake**: Click the "Check" button to analyze the file. The application will display whether the content is likely a deepfake or not.
3. **Record Verification**: The result is also recorded on the Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract.
